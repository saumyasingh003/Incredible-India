                Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is one of the most 
                significant and widely celebrated festivals in India. It symbolizes the victory of
                 light over darkness and good over evil. The atmosphere during Diwali is filled with
                  joy and excitement as people light oil lamps and candles, adorning their homes with 
                  colorful decorations. Families come together to share delicious sweets and exchange 
                  heartfelt gifts, reinforcing bonds of love and unity. The night sky comes alive with 
                  a spectacular display of fireworks, painting a vivid picture of the triumph of light 
                  and goodness.
