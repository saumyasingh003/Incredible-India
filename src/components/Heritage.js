                Hawa Mahal, located in Jaipur, India, is a stunning five-story
                palace known for its intricate honeycomb-like fa√ßade with
                numerous small windows and balconies. Built in 1799 by Maharaja
                Sawai Pratap Singh, the palace was designed to allow royal women
                to observe street festivities while maintaining their privacy.
                Its unique architectural style, resembling the crown of Lord
                Krishna, showcases a blend of Rajput and Islamic influences. A
                remarkable landmark, Hawa Mahal stands as a testament to

                Jim Corbett National Park is a national park in India located in

                renamed Corbett National Park after the hunter and naturalist
                Jim Corbett.
